My favorite code quote, "<span id="k">Efficiency consists in a resolute mind.</span>".

Hey There! I am Katheeskumar (Software Engineer, Open Source Developer / Contributor, Entrepreneur.) 🇱🇰. 
<p>I am currently working as freelancing.</p>

<p> I love to coding and have done so for 9,000 hours over the past four years. I’m great at knowing the right algorithm for a problem because I read computer science literature constantly. I like Algorithms based problems. I love working with people to do things bigger than I could accomplish alone. I’m motivated by big problems, and I think you’ve got some here that I can help solve.”</p>
